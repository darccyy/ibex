# fix `if` and `for` syntax

:if
    - next back: must be group
    - next back:
        `else`
            - next back: must be group
            - rest: `if` condition
        otherwise rest: `if` condition
    this can be expanded to `else if` also

:for
    - next back: must be group
    - rest: `for` expression
